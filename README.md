# Prediction Market for Local Events

## Project Description

A decentralized prediction market smart contract that enables users to create and participate in betting markets for local events. Users can create markets for any local event (sports games, weather predictions, election outcomes, etc.), place bets on the outcomes, and earn rewards based on correct predictions. The platform operates entirely on-chain, ensuring transparency and trustless execution.

## Project Vision

To democratize prediction markets by providing a simple, transparent, and decentralized platform where communities can create and participate in prediction markets for local events. Our vision is to harness collective intelligence for better event outcome predictions while creating an engaging and rewarding experience for participants.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Market Creation**: Anyone can create prediction markets for local events with customizable duration (1-168 hours)
- **Betting System**: Users can place ETH bets on YES/NO outcomes for any active market
- **Automated Resolution**: Market creators can resolve markets once the event concludes
- **Proportional Payouts**: Winners receive payouts proportional to their stake and the total pool
- **Platform Fee**: 5% platform fee on winnings to ensure sustainability

### Smart Contract Features
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient storage patterns and minimal external calls
- **Security First**: Comprehensive validation and reentrancy protection
- **Event Transparency**: All actions emit events for easy tracking and analytics
- **User Balance Management**: Secure withdrawal system for user earnings
- **One Bet Per User**: Prevents gaming and ensures fair participation

### User Experience
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-understand betting mechanics
- **Real-time Updates**: Track market statistics and your positions
- **Flexible Duration**: Markets can run from 1 hour to 1 week
- **Immediate Settlement**: Instant payout calculation upon market resolution

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Features
- **Multi-outcome Markets**: Support for markets with more than 2 possible outcomes
- **Partial Bet Withdrawal**: Allow users to withdraw portions of their bets before market end
- **Market Categories**: Organize markets by categories (Sports, Weather, Politics, etc.)
- **Reputation System**: Track user prediction accuracy over time

### Phase 2: Advanced Functionality
- **Oracle Integration**: Automated market resolution using external data feeds
- **Liquidity Pools**: Allow users to provide liquidity and earn fees
- **Cross-chain Support**: Deploy on multiple blockchain networks
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for better user experience

### Phase 3: Community Features
- **Governance Token**: Community-driven platform decisions
- **Market Maker Incentives**: Rewards for users who create popular markets
- **Social Features**: Comments, market discussions, and user profiles
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive statistics and market insights

### Phase 4: Enterprise Solutions
- **White-label Platform**: Customizable prediction markets for organizations
- **API Integration**: REST API for third-party integrations
- **Institutional Features**: Higher betting limits and advanced risk management
- **Compliance Tools**: KYC/AML integration for regulated markets

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure
```

## Getting Started

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy Project.sol to your chosen network
2. **Create Market**: Call `createMarket()` with event description and duration
3. **Place Bets**: Users call `placeBet()` with their prediction and ETH stake
4. **Resolve Market**: Creator calls `resolveMarketAndClaim()` with final outcome
5. **Claim Winnings**: Winners call `claimWinnings()` to receive their rewards
